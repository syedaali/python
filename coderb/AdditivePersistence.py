'''
Using the Python language, have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the
num parameter being passed which will always be a positive integer and return
its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits
in num until you reach a single digit. For example: if num is 2718 then your
program should return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop
at 9.
